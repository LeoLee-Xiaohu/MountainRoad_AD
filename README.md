# MountainRoad_AD

# This is a simulation environment that simulates mountain ereas with the features of curvy steep narrow road for autonomous driving.
The simulation environment is developed based on the Unity3D platform and Unity ML-Agent toolkits. Also, thanks to the multiple prefabs of Karting Game of Unity, the environment achieved simulation of mountain driving for autonomous vehicles.

How to implement this simulation environment?
1. Please download the package of MountainRoad_AD, and open it as a project with Unity3D. 
2. Find the "scence" file in Unity UI, and select a scence.
3. Select a "model" from the "TF models" file for a vehicle agent.
4. Click the "play" button to see the driving performance of vehicle agents.

If you want to train your own agent, please use the ML-Agent toolkit (the link: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). Note that only ML-agent toolkit version-13 is available for this simulation environment, please be careful of version-13 when you install the ML-agent tookit. Do not install the wrong version!
